## ggplot2 Tutorial:

**You can find the latest version on my [homepage](https://cedricscherer.netlify.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/).**

The initial version of this tutorial follows a blog entry called [**Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet**](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/) by zev@zevross.com, posted on 4. August 2014, updated last in January 2016.
Most changes were made to have a updated version, to follow the [R style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html), to change style and aesthetics of plots to be (more) beautiful and meaningful as well as to include additional tipps. Beside that, data import and setup was modified to RDS.
